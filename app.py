#if __name__ == "__main__": is a common idiom used in Python scripts to check if the script is being run directly by the Python interpreter or if it's being imported as a module into another script. If the script is being run directly, the code block under this condition will be executed.
#in the case of a Flask application, this check ensures that the Flask development server (app.run()) is only started when the script is executed directly, rather than when it's imported as a module into another script. This is because when the Flask application is imported, you typically don't want the development server to start automatically; you might want to use it in a larger application structure or in production with a different server configuration.

if __name__ =="__main__":
    app.run()
